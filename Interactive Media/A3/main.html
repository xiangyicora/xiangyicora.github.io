        <!-- At first, the action I chose was dragging. However, during the programming process, 
            I found that using drag and drop combined with JavaScript to make the interactive action of opening the door was a big challenge for me. 
            There were some problems that were difficult to solve during the process, so I finally decided to change it to a click action, 
            that is, click the mouse to open the door and hover to the door to automatically close the door. 
            This also contributed to an interesting interactive effect.   -->

        <!-- Northern Snow: Inspired by winter in the northern town where I live. I tried to create a snowy, silver-clad atmosphere with different chords, 
            recordings of the wind, and the sound of stepping in the snow. The second half of the track I found interesting, I added some bell chords to make it suddenly jumpy, 
            lively and a little mysterious, but it only lasted for a short while before the bell came to an abrupt end. 
            You walking in the snow suddenly saw a silver fox and wanted to follow in its footsteps, but the snow fox had already disappeared in the heavy snow... 
        -->

        <!-- Island in Lake: I found recordings of rivers, birdsong, and some subtle white noise on the Freesound website, combining them with simple chords. 
            The track might sound like a scene of someone meditating with their backs to the woods, facing the sparkling lake. 
            I wanted it to happen naturally and cause a calming space, and I didn't add a lot of complicated chords. 
        -->

        <!-- City Rainy Night: To this track I added recordings of rain, cassettes, and cars passing by, hoping to draw the listener to a night of heavy traffic: 
            it was raining heavily in the city, and vehicles were passing by your, splashing the rain. You took out his earphones and played a song. Everything around him seemed to be drifting away...

        <!-- Sencha: In a leisurely afternoon, you travel to a warm room, making tea and reading your favorite book... -->
